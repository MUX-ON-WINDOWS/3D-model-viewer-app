## General info
I want to build an app where a 3D model can be displayed and rendered. This process of displaying and rendering will be really simple. The reason I want to build this app is so that students, whether they are making a 3D model or downloading one, can use the app to showcase their models.


## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Electron.js
* React.js + Vite
* Three.js

## Visuals
The visuals are made in Adobe XD. I have made a clickable prototype. The prototype can befound in this [link](https://xd.adobe.com/view/e31fefe9-3f11-4d4d-a94e-bc56b1ee5346-b64c/screen/9a57f2a1-0426-4817-9f32-6799c8bb94ef).
